## Project Name

**CampusConnect — Sponsorship Marketplace for Student Events**

---

## What We Are Building

CampusConnect is a web-based two-sided marketplace that connects **college event organizers** and **brands** on a single professional platform.

The product replaces the current cold-email + WhatsApp sponsorship culture with a structured workflow where students can create standardized sponsorship proposals and brands can discover, evaluate, and manage campus partnerships with measurable ROI.

The platform handles the **complete sponsorship lifecycle**:
Discovery → Pitch → Negotiation → Agreement → Execution → Proof → Payment → Review

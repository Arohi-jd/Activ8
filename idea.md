**Active8 — Sponsorship Marketplace for Student Events**

---

## **Problem Statement**

Currently, student organizers secure sponsorships through cold emails, social media messages, and informal contacts.
This process leads to:

* Very low response rates
* Lack of credibility for student organizers
* No structured negotiation process
* No verification of deliverables
* No measurable ROI for brands

As a result, brands hesitate to invest in campus marketing, and student events struggle to obtain funding.

CampusConnect solves this by introducing a structured and verified collaboration platform.

---

## **What We Are Building**

CampusConnect is a web-based **two-sided marketplace** that connects **verified college organizers** and **brands** on a professional platform.

The system converts informal sponsorship outreach into a structured workflow:

**Discovery → Application → Acceptance → Communication → Execution → Proof Verification → Closure**

Instead of scattered conversations, all sponsorship interactions occur inside a controlled environment.

---

## **Primary Users**

1. **College Admin**

   * Verifies students and manages institute presence

2. **Student Organizer (Club / Society / Fest Team)**

   * Creates events and requests sponsorships

3. **Brand / Company**

   * Finds events and collaborates with organizers

4. **Platform Admin**

---

## **Core Objective**

Create a trusted ecosystem where:

* Students can professionally request sponsorship

* Partnerships are structured and accountable

---

## **Platform Workflow**

### 1. Institutional Verification

* College registers on the platform
* Platform Admin verifies institute

### 2. Marketplace Discovery

Two parallel marketplaces operate:

**Sponsor Marketplace (for Students)**

### 3. Structured Application System

This prevents spam and ensures professionalism.

Brands review submissions and verify completion.
